# Qinetiq-RWP

This project was part of my University course, as a module Real World Project.

The task given was to create a system that will analyse data and and establish the people affected by an Anthrax outbreak. 

My contribution towards this project can be seen in this repository. 
I created a generator which will create movement paths with realistic patterns using OpenRouteService and GeoNames.
With ORS, I was able to get the accurate path between longer points and with GN I mimicked movement to certain places in the travelled nodes.

In addition to the movement data, this generator creates individual user data and links it all together.
User data involves the following:
- Full name.
- Age.
- Health symptoms.
